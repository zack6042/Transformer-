# Transformer Model

## Overview
This repository contains a Transformer model designed for text translation from English to Arabic.

## Model Description
The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need", revolutionizes the way we perform text translations by relying solely on attention mechanisms and dispensing with recurrent layers. This model demonstrates how to apply Transformers for language translation tasks, specifically translating English text into Arabic.

## Accessing the Notebook
The Jupyter notebook is fully implemented on Google Colab and can be accessed via the link below:
- [Transformer Model Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vbcMC1kSODtftML--Tc3f4jTH-UJJsh4?usp=sharing)

## How to Use
To use the notebook:
1. Click on the link above to open it in Google Colab.
2. Go to `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` if you want to have a personal copy and run it.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the translation model.

## Features
- English to Arabic text translation
- Implementation of Transformer architecture
- Utilization of self-attention mechanisms for enhanced translation accuracy

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need a Google account and access to Google Colab. No additional installation is required, as Google Colab provides an environment with all necessary libraries pre-installed.
